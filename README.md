Labs on the basics of C# and Windows Forms

## Description of laboratory work
### Lab1
The following tasks have been implemented:
1. Create console and Windows Forms projects that perform bitwise addition of two strings (your last name and first name) with intermediate results displayed.
2. Given a natural number: find the number of even digits in the number; determine whether the given digit A appears in the number more than twice (A is entered from the keyboard). Find all four-digit numbers for which the sum of the outermost digits is equal to the sum of the middle digits, and the number itself is divisible by 6 and 27.
3. Implement data encryption according to the standard AES.
### Lab2
The following tasks have been implemented:
1. Task 1:
* Implement an information transformation algorithm using logical expressions or cryptographic methods in Assembly language as a separate static library. In the C/C++ module, include the static library and call the ASM procedure, ensuring streaming input/output of external data.
* Implement procedures for multiplying an unsigned integer (entered from the keyboard) by a power of 2 using the bitwise left shift operation <<. Perform a check to ensure that shifting the bit does not result in the loss of the original binary data. Use register memory class when describing variables.
2. Create a software project with a secure user interface. Log the handled exceptions in the textbox of the project's MAIN form and in a text file, including the date, time of occurrence of the exceptions, and the stack trace of the methods that led to the exception.
3. Given an array of integers consisting of 10 elements. Fill it from the keyboard (provide the option to input the array randomly and randomly with a specified frequency).
Find: 
      * The double sum of positive elements;
      * Output the indices of those elements whose values are greater than the value of the previous element (starting from the second element);
      * Determine if there are 2 pairs of adjacent elements with the same sign;
4. Implement the Queue data structure on two Stacks.
### Lab3
The following tasks have been implemented:
1. Develop a graphic image editing software capable of:
    * Creating, opening, saving, and editing scalable raster images.
    * Using tools to select drawing parameters such as line width, line type, drawing method, line color, background color, and fill color.
    * Displaying "live" Fourier signals with rectangular, triangular, or sawtooth envelope waveforms.
    * Ensuring efficient utilization of system resources.
    * Automatically redrawing the image when resizing, closing, or minimizing the windows.
2. Create a program that draws regular fractals of the Pythagoras tree and the Sierpinski carpet. The number of recursive calls is adjustable by the user and the fractal is automatically redrawn. The filling of the figure should gradually change in a gradient manner with each recursive iteration (Use asynchronous mode of operation).
3. Implement a recursive algorithm for drawing Fibonacci numbers.
### Lab4
The following tasks have been implemented:
1. Develop a program that implements the following functionality:
    * Extraction of occurrences with a specific signature. Use a different color for each new request.
    * Add the ability to search for signatures not only in files but also in text entered into a special input field.
    * For the generated log journal on the FIRST form of the project, determine in which forms exceptions occurred and how many times they appeared in each form (highlight the inclusion of form names in the log journal with a different color).
    * As a result of parsing, highlight all occurrences with the word "form" in the log journal, adding your IP address in a different color if those entries fall within the time interval entered by the user (from hh:mm:ss to hh:mm:ss).
    * Implement parsing of saved log journals in a DLL (with a separate class in the DLL for each regular expression).
